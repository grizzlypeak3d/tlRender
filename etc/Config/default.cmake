# Personal settings go in etc/Config/local.cmake, which is not tracked. It is
# included first, and a plain cache set does not overwrite a value already
# there, so anything it sets wins. Files below layer the same way: their own
# values come before the file they are based on.

# For the number of build jobs, set CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL.
