"""Report the signatures a type stub could not resolve.

Usage: check_stub.py <stub.pyi>...

nanobind writes a stub from the bindings themselves, and where a C++ type
was never bound it writes the C++ name as a string annotation:

    def setCloseCallback(self, arg: "std::function<void ()>", /) -> None: ...

That is not a type Python knows, so editors and type checkers make nothing
of it: the argument is as opaque as it was without the stub. Each one is a
binding to fix -- a caster header the translation unit did not include, an
enum or an observable never bound -- so they are printed as warnings, with
the count, rather than left in the file for someone to notice.

Warnings only: an unresolved signature is worth fixing, not worth stopping
a build over, and the stub is still correct for everything else.
