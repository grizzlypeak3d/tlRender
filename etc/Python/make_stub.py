"""Write a type stub for a module that is not installed yet.

Usage: make_stub.py --dll-dir <dir>... -- <stubgen.py> <stubgen arguments>...

nanobind's stubgen imports the module to read its bindings from it, and in
the build tree the libraries it links are not beside it: on Windows there
is no rpath, and since Python 3.8 an extension module's dependencies are
found through os.add_dll_directory() alone -- not PATH. So the directories
they are in are named here, before stubgen imports anything. The same
reason tests/run-python-tests.py exists.

Elsewhere the rpath recorded in the module covers it and the directories
are ignored.
