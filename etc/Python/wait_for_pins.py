"""Wait for the wheels pyproject.toml pins to be on PyPI.

Usage: wait_for_pins.py [--timeout MINUTES] [--pyproject FILE]

A release tags the projects it is made of one after another, and each is
built against the wheel of the one before, which is on PyPI only once that
one's own build has finished and been published. Tagged a few minutes too
soon, this build failed where it first asked for the wheel. So it asks here
first, and waits: the tags can then be pushed together.

Asked through pip, for this machine, since that is what the build then does:
the index has listed a file before every one of its servers would hand it
over.

Only a tag waits. Any other build asks once, since the pins of an unreleased
version are on main before the release they name, and waiting would not
bring it.
